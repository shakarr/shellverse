# Description

Shellverse is a simple tool made in python with which you can get fast access to a different variety of reverse shell codes to copy to the clipboard, like python, bash, node, among many other.

I have decided to create this tool to reduce the time when I make machines in HTB and I need to create a reverse shell depending on the situation

# Future implementations

- [ ] auto implement listener with netcat when you choice an option in a new terminal
- [ ] save the code generated in a file with its corresponding extension
